## Handling ChatOps Behind a Firewall

A common security concern with ChatOps is how to protect your network/application from malicious activity. In order to do so proper firewall policy should be implemented. Through trials, researching, and testing in multiple environments, allowing inbound connections from `52.112.0.0/14` has proven to be successful. Although Microsoft doesn't publish all their ranges this range was found in a [Microsoft Blog Post](https://blog.botframework.com/2020/11/23/bots-secured-behind-a-firewall-teams/) and has yielded success in locked down environments. Additionally Microsoft Posted their [IP Address and DNS ranges](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide#skype-for-business-online-and-microsoft-teams).
